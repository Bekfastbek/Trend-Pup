# Solana Blockchain: Overview

## Core Technology

Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and cryptocurrencies. Founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, it's known for:

- **High throughput**: Processes up to 65,000+ transactions per second (TPS)
- **Low latency**: Average block time of 400 milliseconds
- **Low transaction fees**: Typically fractions of a cent ($0.00025 on average)
- **Energy efficiency**: Uses Proof of History (PoH) and Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus

## Unique Technology Features

### Proof of History (PoH)
- A verifiable delay function that creates a historical record proving events occurred during a specific moment in time
- Allows for time-sequencing of transactions without requiring all validators to agree on timing
- Acts as a cryptographic clock, enabling Solana's high performance

### Tower BFT
- A PoH-optimized version of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- Allows validators to vote on the validity of sequences of blocks with minimal communication overhead

### Turbine
- Block propagation protocol that breaks data into smaller pieces for efficient network transmission
- Enables quick propagation even as the validator set grows

### Gulf Stream
- Mempool-less transaction forwarding protocol
- Pushes transaction caching to the edge of the network, enabling validators to execute transactions ahead of time

### Sealevel
- Parallel smart contract runtime that allows thousands of contracts to run concurrently
- Maximizes hardware efficiency by running transactions in parallel on multiple CPU cores

### Pipelining
- Transaction processing optimization technique that assigns a specialized hardware to different stages of transaction processing
- Creates an assembly line of validation steps for enhanced efficiency

### Cloudbreak
- Horizontally-scaled accounts database that optimizes concurrent reads and writes across the network
- Enables parallel processing of program instructions that access different accounts

### Archivers
- Distributed ledger storage allowing validators to offload data storage to nodes specifically designed for the task
- Ensures the network maintains its history without burdening validators

## Ecosystem Overview

- **Native token**: SOL (used for transaction fees, staking, and governance)
- **Total supply**: 511,616,946 SOL
- **Validators**: 1,000+ active validators securing the network
