# Solana Technical Details

## Network Performance

### Transaction Speed and Throughput
- Theoretical maximum: 65,000+ TPS (transactions per second)
- Sustained mainnet performance: ~2,000-4,000 TPS under normal conditions
- Block time: ~400 milliseconds (compared to Bitcoin's 10 minutes and Ethereum's 12 seconds)
- Finality time: ~13 seconds (time required for transaction irreversibility)

### Network Architecture
- 1,900+ validator nodes securing the network (as of Q1 2025)
- Utilizes 8 key innovations: PoH, Tower BFT, Turbine, Gulf Stream, Sealevel, Pipelining, Cloudbreak, and Archivers
- Horizontally scalable architecture allowing for growth without performance degradation

### Hardware Requirements
- Validators require high-performance hardware (CPU: 12 cores / 24 threads, RAM: 128GB, Storage: 2TB NVMe SSD)
- Higher requirements than many other blockchains, but enables superior performance

## Consensus Mechanism

### Proof of History (PoH)
- Created sequential hashes that encode the passage of time
- Functions as a decentralized clock for the entire network
- Allows validator nodes to agree on the order of events without extensive communication
- Each validator maintains its own clock, providing redundancy and security

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
- SOL token holders can stake tokens to validators
- Validators are selected to produce blocks based on stake weight
- Slashing penalties for malicious behavior
- Current annual staking yield: ~6-7% (varies based on network conditions)

## Economic Model

### Token Economics
- Native token: SOL
- Maximum supply: 511,616,946 SOL (fixed cap)
- Circulating supply: ~418 million SOL (as of Q1 2025)
- Inflation: Started at 8% annually, decreasing by 15% each year until reaching 1.5% long-term
- Current inflation rate: ~4.5% (as of Q1 2025)

### Transaction Fees
- Average transaction fee: ~$0.00025 (a fraction of a cent)
- Fees based on computational resources used rather than network congestion
- Fee prioritization during high congestion periods
- Fees are burned, creating deflationary pressure on SOL supply

## Developer Infrastructure

### Programming Languages
- Primary language: Rust (for performance and security)
- Support for C/C++ programs
- JavaScript/TypeScript via Solana Web3.js SDK
- Python via Solana.py SDK

### Smart Contract Development
- Programs (Solana's term for smart contracts) are deployed as compiled BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) code
- On-chain programs are immutable once deployed
- Upgradable programs possible through proxy pattern
- Account model (different from Ethereum's global state model)

### Account Structure
- Accounts store data and SOL balances
- Program-derived addresses (PDAs) for deterministic account generation
- Rent economy: accounts pay "rent" based on size to remain in validator memory
- Rent-exempt accounts can pre-pay lifetime rent

## Security Features

### Cryptography
- Ed25519 elliptic curve digital signatures
- SHA-256 hash function
- On-chain entropy and randomness through VRF (Verifiable Random Function)

### Network Security
- Resistant to long-range attacks through Tower BFT
- Slashing penalties for validator misbehavior
- Super majority required for fork decisions (>66%)
- Confirmations increase security exponentially

### Auditing and Review
- Core protocol undergoes regular security audits by multiple firms
- Bug bounty program for identifying vulnerabilities
- Open-source codebase allows community review
- SOL Foundation's security measures and incident response teams

## Interoperability

### Bridging Technology
- Wormhole: Cross-chain messaging protocol connecting Solana to other blockchains
- Portal Bridge: Token bridge for transferring assets between chains
- Allbridge: Multi-chain bridge solution
- Native support for wrapped assets (e.g., wBTC, wETH on Solana)

### Composability
- Programs can seamlessly integrate with each other
- Atomic transactions (multiple instructions executed in a single transaction)
- Cross-Program Invocation (CPI) for program-to-program calls
- Transaction simulation for testing complex interactions
