## Physics

- Newton's First Law: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force.
- Einstein's Theory of General Relativity describes gravity as a geometric property of space and time.
- The Standard Model of particle physics classifies all known elementary particles and describes three of the four fundamental forces.
- Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.

## Mathematics

- The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
- Euler's identity (e^(iπ) + 1 = 0) is considered one of the most beautiful equations in mathematics, relating five fundamental mathematical constants.
- Gödel's incompleteness theorems demonstrate the limitations of every formal axiomatic system containing basic arithmetic.
- The Riemann hypothesis is one of the most important unsolved problems in pure mathematics.

## Computer Science

- Big O notation is used in computer science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
- The Turing test, proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, a human.
- P vs NP is a major unsolved problem in computer science, asking whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified can also be quickly solved.
- Machine learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

## History of Science

- Galileo Galilei's observations with the telescope in the early 17th century provided evidence for the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar system.
- Marie Curie was the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields (Physics and Chemistry).
- The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, successfully mapped all of the genes of the human genome.
- The development of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology has revolutionized genetic engineering by providing a way to alter DNA sequences precisely.
